# Valheim-Todo

### What?
Are you stupid like me? Can't keep more then 3 things in your head at one time? Find yourself constantly rechecking chests, recipes, and your inventory? Well congrats cause you just found the crutch you painfully need! Introducing the solution that should just come with EVERY CRAFTING BASED GAME ðŸ˜ ! The Valheim Todo list.

Honestly really frustrating that this isn't just a feature already. I personally couldn't even find a mod for it, but also I play primarly on an un-modded server so I decided to create an external service to track my materials. If you know of a mod that accomplishes this in-game, reach out and I'll happily add a link ðŸ¤˜

### Why?
Very often I am at a loss to keep track of what materials I need to craft objects. I can barely keep track what it takes **exactly** to build a campfire. Let alone when I am about to adventure and need a - Campfire, Portal, possibly a cart, a crafting table and forge, a bed and chest, perhaps enough wall to protect a small outpost and some torches? It's all an arbitrary amount of materials and quantities that can just never stick in my head. So instead of wasting time walking to and from chests cause I accidentally grabbed 5 coal and not 10, I wasted less of my times getting this developed

### How?
Working the program should be very easy.
