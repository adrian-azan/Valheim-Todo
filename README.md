### What?
Are you stupid like me? Can't keep more then 3 things in your head at one time? Find yourself constantly rechecking chests, recipes, and your inventory? Well congrats cause you just found the crutch you painfully need! Introducing the solution that should just come with EVERY CRAFTING BASED GAME ðŸ˜ ! The Valheim Todo list.

Honestly really frustrating that this isn't just a feature already. I personally couldn't even find a mod for it, but also I play primarly on an un-modded server so I didnt look to hard and decided to create an external service to track my materials. If you know of a mod that accomplishes this in-game, reach out and I'll happily add a link ðŸ¤˜

### Why?
Very often I am at a loss to keep track of what materials I need to craft objects. I can barely keep track what it takes **exactly** to build a campfire. Let alone when I am about to adventure and need a - Campfire, Portal, possibly a cart, a crafting table and forge, a bed and chest, perhaps enough wall to protect a small outpost and some torches? It's all an arbitrary amount of materials and quantities that can just never stick in my head. So instead of wasting time walking to and from chests cause I accidentally grabbed 5 coal and not 10, I wasted less of my times getting this developed.

### How?
Working the program should be very easy. Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/adrian-azan/Valheim-Todo/releases) to download the latest version of the software. The zip will include two things. The application, and then a folder full of extensions Godot exports with the application. I'd keep these in the same folder together. Start the application and you should be faced with the todo list!

From here you can select a recipe to start tracking on the todo. **Left clicking** a recipe will add the meterials needed, while **right clicking** the recipe will remove those materials.

To navigate between the different crafting categories you need to use the **'E'** and **'Q'** keys.

I've also added similar functionality for cooking!

You will be able to sort recipes by either Health or Stamina if you are trying to cook up a storm for certain tasks.
